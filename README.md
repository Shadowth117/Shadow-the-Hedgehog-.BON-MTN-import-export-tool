# Shadow-the-Hedgehog-.BON-import
A script for applying external properties from Shadow the Hedgehog .BON files to their respective bones in the .DFF model files after importing said files with AAP's RWIO plugin for 3ds max. This includes reapplying the original names of the bones lost in the output process and adding a few settings specific to .BON files. Eventually this may be continued to allow export of .BON files back to the game.
